# INFO201 Group Project:
#  Title : **Crimes in Los Angeles**
##### Group members: Andrea Koozer, Mustafa Ahamed, Jill Nguyen, Joy Liu

### Project Statement
For our group project, we will be working with the dataset called **Crime Data from 2010 to Present**. We access the dataset at the  [_Data.Gov_](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2010-to-present) website.
 The data is collected and provided by the _local government_ of Los Angeles during the census in 2010. Our main target audiences are government officials, citizens in Los Angeles, and people who are planning to move to or live in the city.

 The data contains every crime information happened from 2010 in Los Angeles. The dataset contains information such as the location  and latitudes of crimes, the crime code, and also housing information such as total households and information of victims such as their ages, sexes, etc. Through our project, we want our audiences to learn some facts such as [at least three specific questions].

### Tackling the issue
We will start our project by reading the Comma Separated Values File of the dataset provided by the website.
- What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?
- What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)
- We might encounter some challenges especially when wrangling the data and producing data visualizations.
