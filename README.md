# INFO201 Group Project:
#  Title : **XXXXXX Los Angeles????**
##### Group members: Andrea Koozer, Mustafa Ahamed, Jill Nguyen, Joy Liu

### Project Statement
For our group project, we will be working with the dataset called **2010 Census Population by Zip Code**. We access the dataset at the  [_Data.Gov_](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2010-census-populations-by-zip-code) website, and it is a non-Federal dataset.
 The data is collected and provided by the _local government_ of Los Angeles during the census in 2010, and the zip codes of this dataset are only limited within the city of Los Angeles. Our main target audiences are government officials, citizens in Los Angeles, and people who are planning to move to or live in the city.

 The data contains general demographic information such as total population, total numbers of males and females in the area, and also housing information such as total households and average household sizes within that area. Through our project, we want our audiences to learn some interesting facts such as [at least three specific questions].

### Tackling the issue
We will start our project by reading the Comma Separated Values File of the dataset provided by the website.
- What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?
- What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)
- We might encounter some challenges especially when wrangling the data and producing data visualizations.
